This README provides an overview of the project's backend outlines guidelines for ensuring adherence to the main project's structure.

# Introduction
We decided to embark on the journey of building the backend infrastructure for PetMe! Leveraging the power of NodeJS, Express, and Prisma technologies, we are confident in create a robust and efficient architecture that will provide a consistent API.

# Technologies
## NodeJS
- NodeJS forms the backbone of our backend development. Its asynchronous and event-driven architecture provides the ideal foundation for handling the dynamic and real-time nature of our platform's operations.

## Express
- Express.js, a fast and minimalistic web application framework for NodeJS, plays a pivotal role in shaping our API endpoints. Its simplicity and flexibility allow us to craft endpoints with ease, catering to the diverse needs of our users.

## Prisma
- Prisma adds a layer of sophistication to our backend. This powerful tool assists in database management and provides a type-safe query builder, ensuring our interactions with the database are both secure and efficient.

# Project Structure
We maintain a clear and organized project structure to enhance collaboration and maintainability. Each component of the backend is thoughtfully placed to ensure a logical flow and easy navigation for contributors.

# Contribution Guidelines
We welcome contributions from the open-source community to help us achieve our mission of better animal welfare through technology. To ensure a harmonious collaboration, we have established some guidelines:

- Issues: Before you begin working on a particular aspect, check the issues section to see if it's already being addressed or if there's a related discussion.

- Branching: For each new feature or bug fix, create a new branch. This keeps the main codebase clean and facilitates smoother integration.

- Code Style: Maintain a consistent code style by following the guidelines outlined in the repository.

- Pull Requests: When submitting a pull request, provide a comprehensive description of the changes you've made. This helps reviewers understand your work better.

- Collaboration: Be respectful of other contributors' opinions and work. Healthy discussions enrich the project.
